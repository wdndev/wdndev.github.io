The new form focuses on high-quality reasoning trajectory selection and contains two novelties: 1) A unified interface for policy and process reward model: we share the backbone network and use task-specific heads for reasoning trajectory predicting and scoring respectively, introducing only 53M extra parameters for trajectory scoring. 2) Eliminating the reliance on process-level annotation: we provide a self-supervised process reward model, which can directly learn the high-quality reasoning trajectory selection from the outcome reward. Equipped with the reflective generative form, MetaStone-S1 is naturally suitable for test-time scaling, and we provide three reasoning effort modes (low, medium, and high) based on the controllable thinking length. Experiments demonstrate that our MetaStone-S1 achieves comparable performance to OpenAI o3-mini's series with only 32B parameter size.

CLiFT enables compute-efficient rendering by compressed tokens, while being capable of changing the number of tokens to represent a scene or render a novel view with one trained network. Concretely, given a set of images, multi-view encoder tokenizes the images with the camera poses. Latent-space K-means selects a reduced set of rays as cluster centroids using the tokens. The multi-view ``condenser'' compresses the information of all the tokens into the centroid tokens to construct CLiFTs. At test time, given a target view and a compute budget (i.e., the number of CLiFTs), the system collects the specified number of nearby tokens and synthesizes a novel view using a compute-adaptive renderer. Extensive experiments on RealEstate10K and DL3DV datasets quantitatively and qualitatively validate our approach, achieving significant data reduction with comparable rendering quality and the highest overall rendering score, while providing trade-offs of data size, rendering quality, and rendering speed.","url":"https://huggingface.co/papers/2507.08776","source":"HuggingFace Papers","timestamp":"2025-07-14T13:58:54.586Z","metadata":{"authors":["Zhengqing Wang","Yuefan Wu","Jiacheng Chen","Fuyang Zhang","Yasutaka Furukawa"],"date":"","rank":2,"llmAnalysis":"","categories":["cs.CV"],"pdfUrl":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.08776.pdf","arxivUrl":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08776","arxivId":"2507.08776","published":"2025-07-11T17:38:52Z","updated":"2025-07-11T17:38:52.000Z"}},{"id":"hf-2-1752501534587","title":"NeuralOS: Towards Simulating Operating Systems via Neural Generative Models","description":"We introduce NeuralOS, a neural framework that simulates graphical user interfaces (GUIs) of operating systems by directly predicting screen frames in response to user inputs such as mouse movements, clicks, and keyboard events.

The model is trained on a large-scale dataset of Ubuntu XFCE recordings, which include both randomly generated interactions and realistic interactions produced by AI agents.

To validate its effectiveness, we apply cache steering to induce chain-of-thought reasoning in small language models. Our approach leverages GPT-4o-generated reasoning traces to construct steering vectors that shift model behavior toward more explicit, multi-step reasoning without fine-tuning or prompt modifications. Experimental evaluations on diverse reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that cache steering improves both the qualitative structure of model reasoning and quantitative task performance. Compared to prior activation steering techniques that require continuous interventions, our one-shot cache steering offers substantial advantages in terms of hyperparameter stability, inference-time efficiency, and ease of integration, making it a more robust and practical solution for controlled generation.","url":"https://huggingface.co/papers/2507.08799","source":"HuggingFace Papers","timestamp":"2025-07-14T13:58:54.587Z","metadata":{"authors":["Max Belitsky","Dawid J.

Leveraging recent advances in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) and generative models, we propose LoongX, a hands-free image editing approach driven by multimodal neurophysiological signals. LoongX utilizes state-of-the-art diffusion models trained on a comprehensive dataset of 23,928 image editing pairs, each paired with synchronized electroencephalography (EEG), functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), photoplethysmography (PPG), and head motion signals that capture user intent. To effectively address the heterogeneity of these signals, LoongX integrates two key modules. The cross-scale state space (CS3) module encodes informative modality-specific features. The dynamic gated fusion (DGF) module further aggregates these features into a unified latent space, which is then aligned with edit semantics via fine-tuning on a diffusion transformer (DiT). Additionally, we pre-train the encoders using contrastive learning to align cognitive states with semantic intentions from embedded natural language. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LoongX achieves performance comparable to text-driven methods (CLIP-I: 0.6605 vs. 0.6558; DINO: 0.4812 vs. 0.4636) and outperforms them when neural signals are combined with speech (CLIP-T: 0.2588 vs. 0.2549). These results highlight the promise of neural-driven generative models in enabling accessible, intuitive image editing and open new directions for cognitive-driven creative technologies. Datasets and code will be released to support future work and foster progress in this emerging area.","url":"https://huggingface.co/papers/2507.05397","source":"HuggingFace Papers","timestamp":"2025-07-14T13:58:54.588Z","metadata":{"authors":["Pengfei Zhou","Jie Xia","Xiaopeng Peng","Wangbo Zhao","Zilong Ye","Zekai Li","Suorong Yang","Jiadong Pan","Yuanxiang Chen","Ziqiao Wang","Kai Wang","Qian Zheng","Xiaojun Chang","Gang Pan","Shurong Dong","Kaipeng Zhang","Yang You"],"date":"","rank":5,"llmAnalysis":"","categories":["cs.CV"],"pdfUrl":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.05397.pdf","arxivUrl":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05397","arxivId":"2507.05397","published":"2025-07-07T18:31:50Z","updated":"2025-07-07T18:31:50.000Z"}},{"id":"hf-5-1752501534588","title":"Lumos-1: On Autoregressive Video Generation from a Unified Model Perspective","description":"Autoregressive large language models (LLMs) have unified a vast range of language tasks, inspiring preliminary efforts in autoregressive video generation. Existing autoregressive video generators either diverge from standard LLM architectures, depend on bulky external text encoders, or incur prohibitive latency due to next-token decoding. In this paper, we introduce Lumos-1, an autoregressive video generator that retains the LLM architecture with minimal architectural modifications. To inject spatiotemporal correlations in LLMs, we identify the efficacy of incorporating 3D RoPE and diagnose its imbalanced frequency spectrum ranges. Therefore, we propose MM-RoPE, a RoPE scheme that preserves the original textual RoPE while providing comprehensive frequency spectra and scaled 3D positions for modeling multimodal spatiotemporal data. Moreover, Lumos-1 resorts to a token dependency strategy that obeys intra-frame bidirectionality and inter-frame temporal causality. Based on this dependency strategy, we identify the issue of frame-wise loss imbalance caused by spatial information redundancy and solve it by proposing Autoregressive Discrete Diffusion Forcing (AR-DF). AR-DF introduces temporal tube masking during training with a compatible inference-time masking policy to avoid quality degradation. By using memory-efficient training techniques, we pre-train Lumos-1 on only 48 GPUs, achieving performance comparable to EMU3 on GenEval, COSMOS-Video2World on VBench-I2V, and OpenSoraPlan on VBench-T2V.

This work investigates how to transfer this principle to Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) to unlock advanced visual reasoning. We introduce a two-stage paradigm built on Qwen2.5-VL-7B: a massive linguistic cold-start fine-tuning, followed by multimodal reinforcement learning (RL) spanning nearly 1,000 steps, surpassing all previous open-source efforts in scale. This pioneering work reveals three fundamental insights: 1) Behavior transfer emerges surprisingly early in cold start due to linguistic mental imagery. 2) Cold start broadly memorizes visual behaviors, while RL critically discerns and scales up effective patterns. 3) Transfer strategically favors high-utility behaviors such as visual reflection. Our resulting model, Open-Vision-Reasoner (OVR), achieves state-of-the-art performance on a suite of reasoning benchmarks, including 95.3% on MATH500, 51.8% on MathVision and 54.6% on MathVerse.

Despite progress, three key limitations persist: (1) Single-latent representations fail to capture complex multi-part geometries, causing detail degradation; (2) Holistic latent coding neglects part independence and interrelationships critical for compositional design; (3) Global conditioning mechanisms lack fine-grained controllability. Inspired by human 3D design workflows, we propose CoPart - a part-aware diffusion framework that decomposes 3D objects into contextual part latents for coherent multi-part generation. This paradigm offers three advantages: i) Reduces encoding complexity through part decomposition; ii) Enables explicit part relationship modeling; iii) Supports part-level conditioning. We further develop a mutual guidance strategy to fine-tune pre-trained diffusion models for joint part latent denoising, ensuring both geometric coherence and foundation model priors. To enable large-scale training, we construct Partverse - a novel 3D part dataset derived from Objaverse through automated mesh segmentation and human-verified annotations. Extensive experiments demonstrate CoPart's superior capabilities in part-level editing, articulated object generation, and scene composition with unprecedented controllability.","url":"https://huggingface.co/papers/2507.08772","source":"HuggingFace Papers","timestamp":"2025-07-14T13:58:54.590Z","metadata":{"authors":["Shaocong Dong","Lihe Ding","Xiao Chen","Yaokun Li","Yuxin Wang","Yucheng Wang","Qi Wang","Jaehyeok Kim","Chenjian Gao","Zhanpeng Huang","Zibin Wang","Tianfan Xue","Dan Xu"],"date":"","rank":8,"llmAnalysis":"","categories":["cs.CV"],"pdfUrl":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.08772.pdf","arxivUrl":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08772","arxivId":"2507.08772","published":"2025-07-11T17:33:18Z","updated":"2025-07-11T17:33:18.000Z"}},{"id":"hf-8-1752501534590","title":"One Token to Fool LLM-as-a-Judge","description":"Generative reward models (also known as LLMs-as-judges), which use large language models (LLMs) to evaluate answer quality, are increasingly adopted in reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR). They are often preferred over rigid rule-based metrics, especially for complex reasoning tasks involving free-form outputs. In this paradigm, an LLM is typically prompted to compare a candidate answer against a ground-truth reference and assign a binary reward indicating correctness. Despite the seeming simplicity of this comparison task, we find that generative reward models exhibit surprising vulnerabilities to superficial manipulations: non-word symbols (e.g., \":\" or \".\") or reasoning openers like \"Thought process:\" and \"Let's solve this problem step by step.\" can often lead to false positive rewards. We demonstrate that this weakness is widespread across LLMs, datasets, and prompt formats, posing a serious threat for core algorithmic paradigms that rely on generative reward models, such as rejection sampling, preference optimization, and RLVR. To mitigate this issue, we introduce a simple yet effective data augmentation strategy and train a new generative reward model with substantially improved robustness. Our findings highlight the urgent need for more reliable LLM-based evaluation methods.

Specifically, we employ a frozen vision foundation model as the encoder of our tokenizer. To enhance its effectiveness, we introduce two key components: (1) a region-adaptive quantization framework that reduces redundancy in the pre-trained features on regular 2D grids, and (2) a semantic reconstruction objective that aligns the tokenizer's outputs with the foundation model's representations to preserve semantic fidelity. Based on these designs, our proposed image tokenizer, VFMTok, achieves substantial improvements in image reconstruction and generation quality, while also enhancing token efficiency. It further boosts autoregressive (AR) generation -- achieving a gFID of 2.07 on ImageNet benchmarks, while accelerating model convergence by three times, and enabling high-fidelity class-conditional synthesis without the need for classifier-free guidance (CFG).

Using Inductive Bias to Probe for World Models","description":"Foundation models are premised on the idea that sequence prediction can uncover deeper domain understanding, much like how Kepler's predictions of planetary motion later led to the discovery of Newtonian mechanics. However, evaluating whether these models truly capture deeper structure remains a challenge. We develop a technique for evaluating foundation models that examines how they adapt to synthetic datasets generated from some postulated world model. Our technique measures whether the foundation model's inductive bias aligns with the world model, and so we refer to it as an inductive bias probe. Across multiple domains, we find that foundation models can excel at their training tasks yet fail to develop inductive biases towards the underlying world model when adapted to new tasks. We particularly find that foundation models trained on orbital trajectories consistently fail to apply Newtonian mechanics when adapted to new physics tasks. Further analysis reveals that these models behave as if they develop task-specific heuristics that fail to generalize.","url":"https://huggingface.co/papers/2507.06952","source":"HuggingFace Papers","timestamp":"2025-07-14T13:58:54.592Z","metadata":{"authors":["Keyon Vafa","Peter G.

However, the non-differentiable and inflexible routing of vanilla MoE hurts model performance. Moreover, while each token activates only a few parameters, these sparsely-activated architectures exhibit low chunk-level sparsity, indicating that the union of multiple consecutive tokens activates a large ratio of parameters. Such a sparsity pattern is unfriendly for acceleration under low-resource conditions (e.g., end-side devices) and incompatible with mainstream acceleration techniques (e.g., speculative decoding). To address these challenges, we introduce a novel MoE architecture, BlockFFN, as well as its efficient training and deployment techniques. Specifically, we use a router integrating ReLU activation and RMSNorm for differentiable and flexible routing. Next, to promote both token-level sparsity (TLS) and chunk-level sparsity (CLS), CLS-aware training objectives are designed, making BlockFFN more acceleration-friendly. Finally, we implement efficient acceleration kernels, combining activation sparsity and speculative decoding for the first time. The experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of BlockFFN over other MoE baselines, achieving over 80% TLS and 70% 8-token CLS. Our kernels achieve up to 3.67$\\times$ speedup on real end-side devices than dense models. All codes and checkpoints are available publicly (https://github.com/thunlp/BlockFFN).","url":"https://huggingface.co/papers/2507.08771","source":"HuggingFace Papers","timestamp":"2025-07-14T13:58:54.592Z","metadata":{"authors":["Chenyang Song","Weilin Zhao","Xu Han","Chaojun Xiao","Yingfa Chen","Yuxuan Li","Zhiyuan Liu","Maosong Sun"],"date":"","rank":13,"llmAnalysis":"","categories":["cs.LG","cs.CL"],"pdfUrl":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.08771.pdf","arxivUrl":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08771","arxivId":"2507.08771","published":"2025-07-11T17:28:56Z","updated":"2025-07-11T17:28:56.000Z"}},{"id":"hf-13-1752501534592","title":"Robust Multimodal Large Language Models Against Modality Conflict","description":"Despite the impressive capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in vision-language tasks, they are prone to hallucinations in real-world scenarios. This paper investigates the hallucination phenomenon in MLLMs from the perspective of modality conflict. Unlike existing works focusing on the conflicts between model responses and inputs, we study the inherent conflicts in inputs from different modalities that place MLLMs in a dilemma and directly lead to hallucinations. We formally define the modality conflict and construct a dataset named Multimodal Modality Conflict (MMMC) to simulate this phenomenon in vision-language tasks. Three methods based on prompt engineering, supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning are proposed to alleviate the hallucination caused by modality conflict. Extensive experiments are conducted on the MMMC dataset to analyze the merits and demerits of these methods. Our results show that the reinforcement learning method achieves the best performance in mitigating the hallucination under modality conflict, while the supervised fine-tuning method shows promising and stable performance. Our work sheds light on the unnoticed modality conflict that leads to hallucinations and provides more insights into the robustness of MLLMs.","url":"https://huggingface.co/papers/2507.07151","source":"HuggingFace Papers","timestamp":"2025-07-14T13:58:54.592Z","metadata":{"authors":["Zongmeng Zhang","Wengang Zhou","Jie Zhao","Houqiang Li"],"date":"","rank":14,"llmAnalysis":"","categories":["cs.CV","cs.AI","cs.CL"],"pdfUrl":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.07151.pdf","arxivUrl":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07151","arxivId":"2507.07151","published":"2025-07-09T11:18:38Z","updated":"2025-07-09T11:18:38.000Z"}}]}
