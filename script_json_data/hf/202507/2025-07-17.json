Existing 3D generation primarily emphasizes geometries and textures while neglecting physical-grounded modeling. Consequently, despite the rapid development of 3D generative models, the synthesized 3D assets often overlook rich and important physical properties, hampering their real-world application in physical domains like simulation and embodied AI. As an initial attempt to address this challenge, we propose \\textbf{PhysX}, an end-to-end paradigm for physical-grounded 3D asset generation. 1) To bridge the critical gap in physics-annotated 3D datasets, we present PhysXNet - the first physics-grounded 3D dataset systematically annotated across five foundational dimensions: absolute scale, material, affordance, kinematics, and function description. In particular, we devise a scalable human-in-the-loop annotation pipeline based on vision-language models, which enables efficient creation of physics-first assets from raw 3D assets.2) Furthermore, we propose \\textbf{PhysXGen}, a feed-forward framework for physics-grounded image-to-3D asset generation, injecting physical knowledge into the pre-trained 3D structural space. Specifically, PhysXGen employs a dual-branch architecture to explicitly model the latent correlations between 3D structures and physical properties, thereby producing 3D assets with plausible physical predictions while preserving the native geometry quality. Extensive experiments validate the superior performance and promising generalization capability of our framework.

As of yet, these models typically overlook the impact of spatial features encoded in spatial audio signals on human motion. To bridge this gap and enable high-quality modeling of human movements in response to spatial audio, we introduce the first comprehensive Spatial Audio-Driven Human Motion (SAM) dataset, which contains diverse and high-quality spatial audio and motion data. For benchmarking, we develop a simple yet effective diffusion-based generative framework for human MOtion generation driven by SPatial Audio, termed MOSPA, which faithfully captures the relationship between body motion and spatial audio through an effective fusion mechanism. Once trained, MOSPA could generate diverse realistic human motions conditioned on varying spatial audio inputs.

We introduce the SOTA open-data Ettin suite of models: paired encoder-only and decoder-only models ranging from 17 million parameters to 1 billion, trained on up to 2 trillion tokens.

Transformer-based LLMs face significant memory and computational bottlenecks as context lengths increase, due to the quadratic complexity of softmax attention and the growing key-value (KV) cache. Lizard addresses these limitations by introducing a subquadratic attention mechanism that closely approximates softmax attention while preserving the output quality. Unlike previous linearization methods, which are often limited by fixed model structures and therefore exclude gating mechanisms, Lizard incorporates a gating module inspired by recent state-of-the-art linear models. This enables adaptive memory control, supports constant-memory inference, offers strong length generalization, and allows more flexible model design. Lizard combines gated linear attention for global context compression with sliding window attention enhanced by meta memory, forming a hybrid mechanism that captures both long-range dependencies and fine-grained local interactions. Moreover, we introduce a hardware-aware algorithm that accelerates the training speed of our models. Extensive experiments show that Lizard achieves near-lossless recovery of the teacher model's performance across standard language modeling tasks, while significantly outperforming previous linearization methods. On the 5-shot MMLU benchmark, Lizard improves over prior models by 18 points and shows significant improvements on associative recall tasks.","url":"https://huggingface.co/papers/2507.09025","source":"HuggingFace Papers","timestamp":"2025-07-17T15:12:32.736Z","metadata":{"authors":["Chien Van Nguyen","Ruiyi Zhang","Hanieh Deilamsalehy","Puneet Mathur","Viet Dac Lai","Haoliang Wang","Jayakumar Subramanian","Ryan A.

We present \\emph{RLEP}\\, -- \\,Reinforcement Learning with Experience rePlay\\, -- \\,a two-phase framework that first collects verified trajectories and then replays them during subsequent training. At every update step, the policy is optimized on mini-batches that blend newly generated rollouts with these replayed successes. By replaying high-quality examples, RLEP steers the model away from fruitless exploration, focuses learning on promising reasoning paths, and delivers both faster convergence and stronger final performance. On the Qwen2.5-Math-7B base model, RLEP reaches baseline peak accuracy with substantially fewer updates and ultimately surpasses it, improving accuracy on AIME-2024 from 38.2% to 39.9%, on AIME-2025 from 19.8% to 22.3%, and on AMC-2023 from 77.0% to 82.2%.

In that line of work, a combination of Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on synthetic demonstrations and Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is used for training Large Language Models to expend extra compute during inference in the form of \"thoughts\" expressed in natural language. In this paper, we propose to instead format these tokens as a multi-turn interaction trace with a stateful tool. At each turn, the new state of the tool is appended to the context of the model, whose job is to generate the tokens necessary to control the tool via a custom DSL. We benchmark this approach on the problem of repairing malfunctioning Python code, and show that this constrained setup allows for faster sampling of experience and a denser reward signal, allowing even models of size up to 3B parameters to learn how to proficiently expend additional compute on the task.","url":"https://huggingface.co/papers/2507.05065","source":"HuggingFace Papers","timestamp":"2025-07-17T15:12:32.739Z","metadata":{"authors":["Corrado Rainone","Tim Bakker","Roland Memisevic"],"date":"","rank":13,"llmAnalysis":"","categories":["cs.LG","cs.AI"],"pdfUrl":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.05065.pdf","arxivUrl":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05065","arxivId":"2507.05065","published":"2025-07-07T14:49:18Z","updated":"2025-07-07T14:49:18.000Z","zh_summary":"最近的进展建立了一种新的机器学习范式，该范式基于在推理时和训练时扩展计算。在这项工作中，综合演示的监督微调（SFT）和具有可验证奖励的强化学习（RLVR）的组合用于训练大型语言模型，以便在推理过程中以自然语言表达的“思想”形式消耗额外的计算。在本文中，我们建议使用有状态工具将这些令牌格式化为多轮交互跟踪。在每个回合，工具的新状态都会附加到模型的上下文中，模型的工作是生成通过自定义DSL控制工具所需的令牌。我们将这种方法与修复故障Python代码的问题进行了基准测试，并表明这种受约束的设置允许更快的经验采样和更密集的奖励信号，甚至允许大小高达3B参数的模型学习如何在任务上熟练地消耗额外的计算。"}}]}
