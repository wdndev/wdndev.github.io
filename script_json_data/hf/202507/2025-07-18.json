This survey introduces Context Engineering, a formal discipline that transcends simple prompt design to encompass the systematic optimization of information payloads for LLMs. We present a comprehensive taxonomy decomposing Context Engineering into its foundational components and the sophisticated implementations that integrate them into intelligent systems. We first examine the foundational components: context retrieval and generation, context processing and context management. We then explore how these components are architecturally integrated to create sophisticated system implementations: retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), memory systems and tool-integrated reasoning, and multi-agent systems. Through this systematic analysis of over 1300 research papers, our survey not only establishes a technical roadmap for the field but also reveals a critical research gap: a fundamental asymmetry exists between model capabilities. While current models, augmented by advanced context engineering, demonstrate remarkable proficiency in understanding complex contexts, they exhibit pronounced limitations in generating equally sophisticated, long-form outputs. Addressing this gap is a defining priority for future research. Ultimately, this survey provides a unified framework for both researchers and engineers advancing context-aware AI.","url":"https://huggingface.co/papers/2507.13334","source":"HuggingFace Papers","timestamp":"2025-07-18T15:04:57.675Z","metadata":{"authors":["Lingrui Mei","Jiayu Yao","Yuyao Ge","Yiwei Wang","Baolong Bi","Yujun Cai","Jiazhi Liu","Mingyu Li","Zhong-Zhi Li","Duzhen Zhang","Chenlin Zhou","Jiayi Mao","Tianze Xia","Jiafeng Guo","Shenghua Liu"],"date":"","rank":1,"llmAnalysis":"","categories":["cs.CL"],"pdfUrl":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.13334.pdf","arxivUrl":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13334","arxivId":"2507.13334","published":"2025-07-17T17:50:36Z","updated":"2025-07-17T17:50:36.000Z","zh_summary":"大型语言模型（LLM）的性能从根本上取决于推理过程中提供的上下文信息。本调查介绍了上下文工程，这是一门超越简单提示设计的正式学科，涵盖了LLM信息有效载荷的系统优化。我们提出了一个全面的分类法，将上下文工程分解为其基本组件以及将它们集成到智能系统中的复杂实现。我们首先研究了基础组件：上下文检索和生成、上下文处理和上下文管理。然后，我们探索这些组件是如何在架构上集成以创建复杂的系统实现的：检索增强生成（RAG）、存储系统和工具集成推理以及多代理系统。通过对1300多篇研究论文的系统分析，我们的调查不仅为该领域建立了技术路线图，还揭示了一个关键的研究差距：模型能力之间存在根本的不对称。虽然当前的模型在高级上下文工程的增强下，在理解复杂上下文方面表现出了非凡的能力，但在生成同样复杂的长篇输出方面却存在明显的局限性。解决这一差距是未来研究的首要任务。最终，这项调查为研究人员和工程师推进情境感知人工智能提供了一个统一的框架。","llm_analysis":"LLM Analysis Failed"}},{"id":"hf-1-1752851097676","title":"VisionThink: Smart and Efficient Vision Language Model via Reinforcement Learning","description":"Recent advancements in vision-language models (VLMs) have improved performance by increasing the number of visual tokens, which are often significantly longer than text tokens. However, we observe that most real-world scenarios do not require such an extensive number of visual tokens. While the performance drops significantly in a small subset of OCR-related tasks, models still perform accurately in most other general VQA tasks with only 1/4 resolution. Therefore, we propose to dynamically process distinct samples with different resolutions, and present a new paradigm for visual token compression, namely, VisionThink. It starts with a downsampled image and smartly decides whether it is sufficient for problem solving. Otherwise, the model could output a special token to request the higher-resolution image. Compared to existing Efficient VLM methods that compress tokens using fixed pruning ratios or thresholds, VisionThink autonomously decides whether to compress tokens case by case. As a result, it demonstrates strong fine-grained visual understanding capability on OCR-related tasks, and meanwhile saves substantial visual tokens on simpler tasks. We adopt reinforcement learning and propose the LLM-as-Judge strategy to successfully apply RL to general VQA tasks. Moreover, we carefully design a reward function and penalty mechanism to achieve a stable and reasonable image resize call ratio. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority, efficiency, and effectiveness of our method.

Although existing studies have predominantly focused on data-driven approaches for arithmetic operations and symbolic manipulation tasks, these approaches tend to be task-specific with limited overall performance. To pursue a more general solution, this paper focuses on a broader case of reasoning problems that are computable, i.e., problems that algorithms can solve, thus can be solved by the Turing Machine. From this perspective, this paper proposes Turing MAchine Imitation Learning (TAIL) to improve the length generalization ability of LLMs. TAIL synthesizes chain-of-thoughts (CoT) data that imitate the execution process of a Turing Machine by computer programs, which linearly expands the reasoning steps into atomic states to alleviate shortcut learning and explicit memory fetch mechanism to reduce the difficulties of dynamic and long-range data access in elementary operations. To validate the reliability and universality of TAIL, we construct a challenging synthetic dataset covering 8 classes of algorithms and 18 tasks. Without bells and whistles, TAIL significantly improves the length generalization ability as well as the performance of Qwen2.5-7B on various tasks using only synthetic data, surpassing previous methods and DeepSeek-R1. The experimental results reveal that the key concepts in the Turing Machine, instead of the thinking styles, are indispensable for TAIL for length generalization, through which the model exhibits read-and-write behaviors consistent with the properties of the Turing Machine in their attention layers. This work provides a promising direction for future research in the learning of LLM reasoning from synthetic data.","url":"https://huggingface.co/papers/2507.13332","source":"HuggingFace Papers","timestamp":"2025-07-18T15:04:57.678Z","metadata":{"authors":["Zhouqi Hua","Wenwei Zhang","Chengqi Lyu","Yuzhe Gu","Songyang Gao","Kuikun Liu","Kai Chen"],"date":"","rank":4,"llmAnalysis":"","categories":["cs.CL"],"pdfUrl":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.13332.pdf","arxivUrl":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13332","arxivId":"2507.13332","published":"2025-07-17T17:50:07Z","updated":"2025-07-17T17:50:07.000Z","zh_summary":"长度泛化，即解决比训练过程中观察到的序列更长的问题的能力，是基于Transformer的大型语言模型（LLM）的核心挑战。尽管现有的研究主要集中在算术运算和符号操作任务的数据驱动方法上，但这些方法往往是针对特定任务的，整体性能有限。为了寻求更通用的解决方案，本文关注的是更广泛的可计算推理问题，即算法可以解决的问题，因此可以通过图灵机来解决。从这个角度来看，本文提出了图灵机器模仿学习（TAIL）来提高LLM的长度泛化能力。TAIL通过计算机程序合成模仿图灵机执行过程的思维链（CoT）数据，将推理步骤线性扩展到原子状态，以减轻快捷学习和显式内存提取机制，从而降低基本操作中动态和远程数据访问的难度。为了验证TAIL的可靠性和通用性，我们构建了一个具有挑战性的合成数据集，涵盖8类算法和18个任务。在没有花哨功能的情况下，TAIL显著提高了长度泛化能力，以及Qwen2.5-7B在仅使用合成数据的各种任务上的性能，超越了之前的方法和DeepSeek-R1。实验结果表明，在TAIL进行长度泛化时，图灵机中的关键概念而不是思维方式是必不可少的，通过这些概念，模型在其注意层中表现出与图灵机属性一致的读写行为。这项工作为未来从合成数据中学习LLM推理的研究提供了一个有前景的方向。","llm_analysis":"LLM Analysis Failed"}},{"id":"hf-4-1752851097680","title":"AnyCap Project: A Unified Framework, Dataset, and Benchmark for Controllable Omni-modal Captioning","description":"Controllable captioning is essential for precise multimodal alignment and instruction following, yet existing models often lack fine-grained control and reliable evaluation protocols.

Previous methods solve the issue of insufficient observation by leveraging 4D diffusion models to generate videos at novel viewpoints. However, the generated videos from these models often lack spatio-temporal consistency, thus degrading view synthesis quality. In this paper, we propose a novel sliding iterative denoising process to enhance the spatio-temporal consistency of the 4D diffusion model. Specifically, we define a latent grid in which each latent encodes the image, camera pose, and human pose for a certain viewpoint and timestamp, then alternately denoising the latent grid along spatial and temporal dimensions with a sliding window, and finally decode the videos at target viewpoints from the corresponding denoised latents. Through the iterative sliding, information flows sufficiently across the latent grid, allowing the diffusion model to obtain a large receptive field and thus enhance the 4D consistency of the output, while making the GPU memory consumption affordable. The experiments on the DNA-Rendering and ActorsHQ datasets demonstrate that our method is able to synthesize high-quality and consistent novel-view videos and significantly outperforms the existing approaches.

This paper introduces a residual learning approach that addresses this feature blindness without requiring complete retraining. We propose training a secondary SAE specifically to model the reconstruction error of a pretrained SAE on domain-specific texts, effectively capturing features missed by the primary model. By summing the outputs of both models during inference, we demonstrate significant improvements in both LLM cross-entropy and explained variance metrics across multiple specialized domains. Our experiments show that this method efficiently incorporates new domain knowledge into existing SAEs while maintaining their performance on general tasks.

This is due to the rigidity of their subword tokenizers, which typically remain unchanged during adaptation. This inflexibility often leads to inefficient tokenization, causing overfragmentation of out-of-distribution domains, unseen languages, or scripts. In this work, we develop byte-level LMs with learnable tokenizers to make tokenization adaptive. Our models include a submodule that learns to predict boundaries between the input byte sequence, encoding it into variable-length segments. Existing tokenizer-free methods train this boundary predictor using an auxiliary loss that enforces a fixed compression rate across the training corpus, introducing a new kind of rigidity. We propose FLEXITOKENS, a simplified training objective that enables significantly greater flexibility during adaptation. Evaluating across multiple multilingual benchmarks, morphologically diverse tasks, and domains, we demonstrate that FLEXITOKENS consistently reduces token over-fragmentation and achieves up to 10\\% improvements on downstream task performance compared to subword and other gradient-based tokenizers.

Recent approaches apply diffusion models (both image-based and video-based) in this task and achieve strong performance. However, image-based diffusion models are unable to extract temporal information and are relatively inefficient compared to non-diffusion methods. Video-based diffusion models can extract temporal information, but they are too large in terms of training scale, model size, and inference time. To mitigate the above issues, we propose Temporal-Aware Latent Brownian Bridge Diffusion for Video Frame Interpolation (TLB-VFI), an efficient video-based diffusion model. By extracting rich temporal information from video inputs through our proposed 3D-wavelet gating and temporal-aware autoencoder, our method achieves 20% improvement in FID on the most challenging datasets over recent SOTA of image-based diffusion models. Meanwhile, due to the existence of rich temporal information, our method achieves strong performance while having 3times fewer parameters. Such a parameter reduction results in 2.3x speed up. By incorporating optical flow guidance, our method requires 9000x less training data and achieves over 20x fewer parameters than video-based diffusion models.

AutoSteer incorporates three core components: (1) a novel Safety Awareness Score (SAS) that automatically identifies the most safety-relevant distinctions among the model's internal layers; (2) an adaptive safety prober trained to estimate the likelihood of toxic outputs from intermediate representations; and (3) a lightweight Refusal Head that selectively intervenes to modulate generation when safety risks are detected. Experiments on LLaVA-OV and Chameleon across diverse safety-critical benchmarks demonstrate that AutoSteer significantly reduces the Attack Success Rate (ASR) for textual, visual, and cross-modal threats, while maintaining general abilities.
