They are often preferred over rigid rule-based metrics, especially for complex reasoning tasks involving free-form outputs. In this paradigm, an LLM is typically prompted to compare a candidate answer against a ground-truth reference and assign a binary reward indicating correctness. Despite the seeming simplicity of this comparison task, we find that generative reward models exhibit surprising vulnerabilities to superficial manipulations: non-word symbols (e.g., \":\" or \".\") or reasoning openers like \"Thought process:\" and \"Let's solve this problem step by step.\" can often lead to false positive rewards. We demonstrate that this weakness is widespread across LLMs, datasets, and prompt formats, posing a serious threat for core algorithmic paradigms that rely on generative reward models, such as rejection sampling, preference optimization, and RLVR. To mitigate this issue, we introduce a simple yet effective data augmentation strategy and train a new generative reward model with substantially improved robustness. Our findings highlight the urgent need for more reliable LLM-based evaluation methods.

However, existing jailbreaking methods are computationally costly. In this paper, we propose the weak-to-strong jailbreaking attack, an efficient inference time attack for aligned LLMs to produce harmful text. Our key intuition is based on the observation that jailbroken and aligned models only differ in their initial decoding distributions. The weak-to-strong attack's key technical insight is using two smaller models (a safe and an unsafe one) to adversarially modify a significantly larger safe model's decoding probabilities. We evaluate the weak-to-strong attack on 5 diverse open-source LLMs from 3 organizations. The results show our method can increase the misalignment rate to over 99% on two datasets with just one forward pass per example. Our study exposes an urgent safety issue that needs to be addressed when aligning LLMs. As an initial attempt, we propose a defense strategy to protect against such attacks, but creating more advanced defenses remains challenging.

It involves the automatic identification and extraction of argumentative components, such as premises and claims, and the detection of relationships between them, such as support, attack, or neutrality. Recently, the field has advanced significantly, especially with the advent of large language models (LLMs), which have enhanced the efficiency of analyzing and extracting argument semantics compared to traditional methods and other deep learning models. There are many benchmarks for testing and verifying the quality of LLM, but there is still a lack of research and results on the operation of these models in publicly available argument classification databases. This paper presents a study of a selection of LLM's, using diverse datasets such as Args.me and UKP. The models tested include versions of GPT, Llama, and DeepSeek, along with reasoning-enhanced variants incorporating the Chain-of-Thoughts algorithm. The results indicate that ChatGPT-4o outperforms the others in the argument classification benchmarks. In case of models incorporated with reasoning capabilities, the Deepseek-R1 shows its superiority. However, despite their superiority, GPT-4o and Deepseek-R1 still make errors. The most common errors are discussed for all models. To our knowledge, the presented work is the first broader analysis of the mentioned datasets using LLM and prompt algorithms. The work also shows some weaknesses of known prompt algorithms in argument analysis, while indicating directions for their improvement. The added value of the work is the in-depth analysis of the available argument datasets and the demonstration of their shortcomings.","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08621v1","source":"ArXiv Domain","timestamp":"2025-07-11T14:23:40.000Z","metadata":{"arxivId":"2507.08621v1","authors":"Marcin Pietroń, Rafał Olszowski, Jakub Gomułka, Filip Gampel, Andrzej Tomski","categories":"cs.CL, cs.AI","published":"2025-07-11T14:23:40Z","pdfUrl":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.08621v1.pdf","abstractUrl":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08621v1","rank":6,"domain":"LLM"}},{"id":"arxiv-2507.08538v1-1752501534622","title":"The AI Language Proficiency Monitor -- Tracking the Progress of LLMs on Multilingual Benchmarks","description":"To ensure equitable access to the benefits of large language models (LLMs), it is essential to evaluate their capabilities across the world's languages.

Interestingly, the experimental results reveal that while the proposed initialization strategy improves the early iterations of LDA, it has no effect on the convergence and yields the worst performance compared to the baselines. The LLM-enabled post-correction, on the other hand, achieved a promising improvement of 5.86% in the coherence evaluation.

The first, carried over from the evaluation of machine learning models in general, relies on pre-defined task instances, for which reference task executions are available. The second, best exemplified by the LM-arena, relies on (often self-selected) users bringing their own intents to a site that routes these to several models in parallel, among whose responses the user then selects their most preferred one. The former paradigm hence excels at control over what is tested, while the latter comes with higher ecological validity, testing actual use cases interactively. Recently, a third complementary paradigm has emerged that combines some of the strengths of these approaches, offering control over multi-turn, reference-free, repeatable interactions, while stressing goal-directedness: dialogue game based evaluation. While the utility of this approach has been shown by several projects, its adoption has been held back by the lack of a mature, easily re-usable implementation. In this paper, we present clembench, which has been in continuous development since 2023 and has in its latest release been optimized for ease of general use. We describe how it can be used to benchmark one's own models (using a provided set of benchmark game instances in English), as well as how easily the benchmark itself can be extended with new, tailor-made targeted tests.","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08491v1","source":"ArXiv Domain","timestamp":"2025-07-11T11:16:01.000Z","metadata":{"arxivId":"2507.08491v1","authors":"David Schlangen, Sherzod Hakimov, Jonathan Jordan, Philipp Sadler","categories":"cs.CL","published":"2025-07-11T11:16:01Z","pdfUrl":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.08491v1.pdf","abstractUrl":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08491v1","rank":9,"domain":"LLM"}},{"id":"arxiv-2507.06892v3-1752501534622","title":"Squeeze the Soaked Sponge: Efficient Off-policy Reinforcement Finetuning for Large Language Model","description":"Reinforcement Learning (RL) has demonstrated its potential to improve the reasoning ability of Large Language Models (LLMs). One major limitation of most existing Reinforcement Finetuning (RFT) methods is that they are on-policy RL in nature, i.e., data generated during the past learning process is not fully utilized. This inevitably comes at a significant cost of compute and time, posing a stringent bottleneck on continuing economic and efficient scaling. To this end, we launch the renaissance of off-policy RL and propose Reincarnating Mix-policy Proximal Policy Gradient (ReMix), a general approach to enable on-policy RFT methods like PPO and GRPO to leverage off-policy data. ReMix consists of three major components: (1) Mix-policy proximal policy gradient with an increased Update-To-Data (UTD) ratio for efficient training; (2) KL-Convex policy constraint to balance the trade-off between stability and flexibility; (3) Policy reincarnation to achieve a seamless transition from efficient early-stage learning to steady asymptotic improvement. In our experiments, we train a series of ReMix models upon PPO, GRPO and 1.5B, 7B base models. ReMix shows an average Pass@1 accuracy of 52.10% (for 1.5B model) with 0.079M response rollouts, 350 training steps and achieves 63.27%/64.39% (for 7B model) with 0.007M/0.011M response rollouts, 50/75 training steps, on five math reasoning benchmarks (i.e., AIME'24, AMC'23, Minerva, OlympiadBench, and MATH500). Compared with 15 recent advanced models, ReMix shows SOTA-level performance with an over 30x to 450x reduction in training cost in terms of rollout data volume. In addition, we reveal insightful findings via multifaceted analysis, including the implicit preference for shorter responses due to the Whipping Effect of off-policy discrepancy, the collapse mode of self-reflection behavior under the presence of severe off-policyness, etc.","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06892v3","source":"ArXiv Domain","timestamp":"2025-07-09T14:29:45.000Z","metadata":{"arxivId":"2507.06892v3","authors":"Jing Liang, Hongyao Tang, Yi Ma, Jinyi Liu, Yan Zheng, Shuyue Hu, Lei Bai, Jianye Hao","categories":"cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.CL","published":"2025-07-09T14:29:45Z","pdfUrl":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.06892v3.pdf","abstractUrl":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06892v3","rank":10,"domain":"LLM"}},{"id":"arxiv-2506.12003v2-1752501534773","title":"Upgrade or Switch: Do We Need a Next-Gen Trusted Architecture for the Internet of AI Agents?","description":"The emerging Internet of AI Agents challenges existing web infrastructure designed for human-scale, reactive interactions. Unlike traditional web resources, autonomous AI agents initiate actions, maintain persistent state, spawn sub-agents, and negotiate directly with peers: demanding millisecond-level discovery, instant credential revocation, and cryptographic behavioral proofs that exceed current DNS/PKI capabilities. This paper analyzes whether to upgrade existing infrastructure or implement purpose-built index architectures for autonomous agents. We identify critical failure points: DNS propagation (24-48 hours vs. required milliseconds), certificate revocation unable to scale to trillions of entities, and IPv4/IPv6 addressing inadequate for agent-scale routing. We evaluate three approaches: (1) Upgrade paths, (2) Switch options, (3) Hybrid index/registries. Drawing parallels to dialup-to-broadband transitions, we find that agent requirements constitute qualitative, and not incremental, changes. While upgrades offer compatibility and faster deployment, clean-slate solutions provide better performance but require longer for adoption. Our analysis suggests hybrid approaches will emerge, with centralized indexes for critical agents and federated meshes for specialized use cases.","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12003v2","source":"ArXiv Domain","timestamp":"2025-06-13T17:55:38.000Z","metadata":{"arxivId":"2506.12003v2","authors":"Ramesh Raskar, Pradyumna Chari, Jared James Grogan, Mahesh Lambe, Robert Lincourt, Raghu Bala, Aditi Joshi, Abhishek Singh, Ayush Chopra, Rajesh Ranjan, Shailja Gupta, Dimitris Stripelis, Maria Gorskikh, Sichao Wang","categories":"cs.NI, cs.AI, cs.MA","published":"2025-06-13T17:55:38Z","pdfUrl":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.12003v2.pdf","abstractUrl":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12003v2","rank":1,"domain":"Agent"}},{"id":"arxiv-2507.08664v1-1752501534773","title":"Introspection of Thought Helps AI Agents","description":"AI Agents rely on Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal-LLMs (MLLMs) to perform interpretation and inference in text and image tasks without post-training, where LLMs and MLLMs play the most critical role and determine the initial ability and limitations of AI Agents.

However, they are still constrained by the inherent limitations of LLM in understanding natural language, and the iterative reasoning process will generate a large amount of inference cost. To this end, we propose a novel AI Agent Reasoning Framework with Introspection of Thought (INoT) by designing a new LLM-Read code in prompt. It enables LLM to execute programmatic dialogue reasoning processes following the code in prompt. Therefore, self-denial and reflection occur within LLM instead of outside LLM, which can reduce token cost effectively. Through our experiments on six benchmarks for three different tasks, the effectiveness of INoT is verified, with an average improvement of 7.95\\% in performance, exceeding the baselines. Furthermore, the token cost of INoT is lower on average than the best performing method at baseline by 58.3\\%.

We evaluate whether a structured multi-agent system (MAS) can more effectively manage requirements extraction, functional decomposition, and simulator code generation than a simpler two-agent system (2AS). The target application is a solar-powered water filtration system as described in a cahier des charges. We introduce the Design-State Graph (DSG), a JSON-serializable representation that bundles requirements, physical embodiments, and Python-based physics models into graph nodes. A nine-role MAS iteratively builds and refines the DSG, while the 2AS collapses the process to a Generator-Reflector loop. Both systems run a total of 60 experiments (2 LLMs - Llama 3.3 70B vs reasoning-distilled DeepSeek R1 70B x 2 agent configurations x 3 temperatures x 5 seeds). We report a JSON validity, requirement coverage, embodiment presence, code compatibility, workflow completion, runtime, and graph size. Across all runs, both MAS and 2AS maintained perfect JSON integrity and embodiment tagging. Requirement coverage remained minimal (less than 20\\%). Code compatibility peaked at 100\\% under specific 2AS settings but averaged below 50\\% for MAS. Only the reasoning-distilled model reliably flagged workflow completion. Powered by DeepSeek R1 70B, the MAS generated more granular DSGs (average 5-6 nodes) whereas 2AS mode-collapsed. Structured multi-agent orchestration enhanced design detail. Reasoning-distilled LLM improved completion rates, yet low requirements and fidelity gaps in coding persisted.","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08619v1","source":"ArXiv Domain","timestamp":"2025-07-11T14:19:05.000Z","metadata":{"arxivId":"2507.08619v1","authors":"Soheyl Massoudi, Mark Fuge","categories":"cs.AI","published":"2025-07-11T14:19:05Z","pdfUrl":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.08619v1.pdf","abstractUrl":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08619v1","rank":6,"domain":"Agent"}},{"id":"arxiv-2507.08584v1-1752501534774","title":"To Trade or Not to Trade: An Agentic Approach to Estimating Market Risk Improves Trading Decisions","description":"Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in agentic frameworks, in which prompts trigger complex tool-based analysis in pursuit of a goal. While these frameworks have shown promise across multiple domains including in finance, they typically lack a principled model-building step, relying instead on sentiment- or trend-based analysis. We address this gap by developing an agentic system that uses LLMs to iteratively discover stochastic differential equations for financial time series. These models generate risk metrics which inform daily trading decisions. We evaluate our system in both traditional backtests and using a market simulator, which introduces synthetic but causally plausible price paths and news events. We find that model-informed trading strategies outperform standard LLM-based agents, improving Sharpe ratios across multiple equities. Our results show that combining LLMs with agentic model discovery enhances market risk estimation and enables more profitable trading decisions.","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08584v1","source":"ArXiv Domain","timestamp":"2025-07-11T13:29:32.000Z","metadata":{"arxivId":"2507.08584v1","authors":"Dimitrios Emmanoulopoulos, Ollie Olby, Justin Lyon, Namid R.

To bridge this gap, we introduce StarDojo, a novel benchmark based on Stardew Valley, designed to assess AI agents in open-ended production-living simulations. In StarDojo, agents are tasked to perform essential livelihood activities such as farming and crafting, while simultaneously engaging in social interactions to establish relationships within a vibrant community. StarDojo features 1,000 meticulously curated tasks across five key domains: farming, crafting, exploration, combat, and social interactions. Additionally, we provide a compact subset of 100 representative tasks for efficient model evaluation. The benchmark offers a unified, user-friendly interface that eliminates the need for keyboard and mouse control, supports all major operating systems, and enables the parallel execution of multiple environment instances, making it particularly well-suited for evaluating the most capable foundation agents, powered by multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Extensive evaluations of state-of-the-art MLLMs agents demonstrate substantial limitations, with the best-performing model, GPT-4.1, achieving only a 12.7% success rate, primarily due to challenges in visual understanding, multimodal reasoning and low-level manipulation. As a user-friendly environment and benchmark, StarDojo aims to facilitate further research towards robust, open-ended agents in complex production-living environments.","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07445v2","source":"ArXiv Domain","timestamp":"2025-07-10T05:48:28.000Z","metadata":{"arxivId":"2507.07445v2","authors":"Weihao Tan, Changjiu Jiang, Yu Duan, Mingcong Lei, Jiageng Li, Yitian Hong, Xinrun Wang, Bo An","categories":"cs.AI","published":"2025-07-10T05:48:28Z","pdfUrl":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.07445v2.pdf","abstractUrl":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07445v2","rank":8,"domain":"Agent"}},{"id":"arxiv-2507.06261v2-1752501534780","title":"Gemini 2.5: Pushing the Frontier with Advanced Reasoning, Multimodality, Long Context, and Next Generation Agentic Capabilities","description":"In this report, we introduce the Gemini 2.X model family: Gemini 2.5 Pro and Gemini 2.5 Flash, as well as our earlier Gemini 2.0 Flash and Flash-Lite models.

In addition to its incredible coding and reasoning skills, Gemini 2.5 Pro is a thinking model that excels at multimodal understanding and it is now able to process up to 3 hours of video content. Its unique combination of long context, multimodal and reasoning capabilities can be combined to unlock new agentic workflows. Gemini 2.5 Flash provides excellent reasoning abilities at a fraction of the compute and latency requirements and Gemini 2.0 Flash and Flash-Lite provide high performance at low latency and cost.

However, these systems have introduced unprecedented security vulnerabilities that extend beyond traditional prompt injection attacks. This paper presents the first comprehensive evaluation of LLM agents as attack vectors capable of achieving complete computer takeover through the exploitation of trust boundaries within agentic AI systems where autonomous entities interact and influence each other. We demonstrate that adversaries can leverage three distinct attack surfaces - direct prompt injection, RAG backdoor attacks, and inter-agent trust exploitation - to coerce popular LLMs (including GPT-4o, Claude-4 and Gemini-2.5) into autonomously installing and executing malware on victim machines. Our evaluation of 17 state-of-the-art LLMs reveals an alarming vulnerability hierarchy: while 41.2% of models succumb to direct prompt injection, 52.9% are vulnerable to RAG backdoor attacks, and a critical 82.4% can be compromised through inter-agent trust exploitation. Notably, we discovered that LLMs which successfully resist direct malicious commands will execute identical payloads when requested by peer agents, revealing a fundamental flaw in current multi-agent security models. Our findings demonstrate that only 5.9% of tested models (1/17) proved resistant to all attack vectors, with the majority exhibiting context-dependent security behaviors that create exploitable blind spots. Our findings also highlight the need to increase awareness and research on the security risks of LLMs, showing a paradigm shift in cybersecurity threats, where AI tools themselves become sophisticated attack vectors.","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06850v3","source":"ArXiv Domain","timestamp":"2025-07-09T13:54:58.000Z","metadata":{"arxivId":"2507.06850v3","authors":"Matteo Lupinacci, Francesco Aurelio Pironti, Francesco Blefari, Francesco Romeo, Luigi Arena, Angelo Furfaro","categories":"cs.CR, cs.AI","published":"2025-07-09T13:54:58Z","pdfUrl":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.06850v3.pdf","abstractUrl":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06850v3","rank":10,"domain":"Agent"}},{"id":"arxiv-2503.11924v2-1752501534886","title":"REGEN: A Dataset and Benchmarks with Natural Language Critiques and Narratives","description":"This paper introduces a novel dataset REGEN (Reviews Enhanced with GEnerative Narratives), designed to benchmark the conversational capabilities of recommender Large Language Models (LLMs), addressing the limitations of existing datasets that primarily focus on sequential item prediction.

The narratives include product endorsements, purchase explanations, and summaries of user preferences. Further, we establish an end-to-end modeling benchmark for the task of conversational recommendation, where models are trained to generate both recommendations and corresponding narratives conditioned on user history (items and critiques). For this joint task, we introduce a modeling framework LUMEN (LLM-based Unified Multi-task Model with Critiques, Recommendations, and Narratives) which uses an LLM as a backbone for critiquing, retrieval and generation. We also evaluate the dataset's quality using standard auto-rating techniques and benchmark it by training both traditional and LLM-based recommender models. Our results demonstrate that incorporating critiques enhances recommendation quality by enabling the recommender to learn language understanding and integrate it with recommendation signals.

To harness the generalization power and world knowledge of LLMs in developing effective information-gathering strategies, we propose an adaptive elicitation framework that actively reduces uncertainty on the latent entity. Since probabilistic modeling of an abstract latent entity is difficult, our framework adopts a predictive view of uncertainty, using a meta-learned language model to simulate future observations and enable scalable uncertainty quantification over complex natural language. Through autoregressive forward simulation, our model quantifies how new questions reduce epistemic uncertainty, enabling the development of sophisticated information-gathering strategies to choose the most informative next queries.

Many of these tables are derived from web sources or real-world scenarios, which require meticulous data preparation (or data prep) to ensure accurate responses. However, preparing such tables for NL questions introduces new requirements that extend beyond traditional data preparation. This question-ware data preparation involves specific tasks such as column derivation and filtering tailored to particular questions, as well as question-aware value normalization or conversion, highlighting the need for a more nuanced approach in this context. Because each of the above tasks is unique, a single model (or agent) may not perform effectively across all scenarios. In this paper, we propose AutoPrep, a large language model (LLM)-based multiagent framework that leverages the strengths of multiple agents, each specialized in a certain type of data prep, ensuring more accurate and contextually relevant responses. Given an NL question over a table, AutoPrep performs data prep through three key components. Planner: Determines a logical plan, outlining a sequence of high-level operations. Programmer: Translates this logical plan into a physical plan by generating the corresponding low-level code. Executor: Executes the generated code to process the table. To support this multi-agent framework, we design a novel Chain-ofClauses reasoning mechanism for high-level operation suggestion, and a tool-augmented method for low-level code generation.","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10422v4","source":"ArXiv Domain","timestamp":"2024-12-10T11:03:49.000Z","metadata":{"arxivId":"2412.10422v4","authors":"Meihao Fan, Ju Fan, Nan Tang, Lei Cao, Guoliang Li, Xiaoyong Du","categories":"cs.CL, cs.AI","published":"2024-12-10T11:03:49Z","pdfUrl":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.10422v4.pdf","abstractUrl":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10422v4","rank":5,"domain":"NLP"}},{"id":"arxiv-2507.08013v1-1752501534886","title":"MedicalBERT: enhancing biomedical natural language processing using pretrained BERT-based model","description":"Recent advances in natural language processing (NLP) have been driven bypretrained language models like BERT, RoBERTa, T5, and GPT.

To this end, we propose a formalization of one key aspect of data quality -- measuring the variability of natural language data -- specifically via a measure we call the diversity coefficient. Our empirical analysis shows that the proposed diversity coefficient aligns with the intuitive properties of diversity and variability, e.g., it increases as the number of latent concepts increases. Then, we measure the diversity coefficient of publicly available pre-training datasets and demonstrate that their formal diversity is high compared to theoretical lower and upper bounds. Finally, we conduct a comprehensive set of controlled interventional experiments with GPT-2 and LLaMAv2 that demonstrate the diversity coefficient of pre-training data characterizes useful aspects of downstream model evaluation performance -- totaling 44 models of various sizes (51M to 7B parameters). We conclude that our formal notion of diversity is an important aspect of data quality that captures variability and causally leads to improved evaluation performance.","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13840v4","source":"ArXiv Domain","timestamp":"2023-06-24T02:25:56.000Z","metadata":{"arxivId":"2306.13840v4","authors":"Brando Miranda, Alycia Lee, Sudharsan Sundar, Allison Casasola, Rylan Schaeffer, Elyas Obbad, Sanmi Koyejo","categories":"cs.CL, cs.AI, cs.LG, cs.NE","published":"2023-06-24T02:25:56Z","pdfUrl":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.13840v4.pdf","abstractUrl":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13840v4","rank":7,"domain":"NLP"}},{"id":"arxiv-2507.00297v1-1752501534886","title":"Natural language processing for African languages","description":"Recent advances in word embeddings and language models use large-scale, unlabelled data and self-supervised learning to boost NLP performance.

In this dissertation, we focus on languages spoken in Sub-Saharan Africa where all the indigenous languages in this region can be regarded as low-resourced in terms of the availability of labelled data for NLP tasks and unlabelled data found on the web. We analyse the noise in the publicly available corpora, and curate a high-quality corpus, demonstrating that the quality of semantic representations learned in word embeddings does not only depend on the amount of data but on the quality of pre-training data. We demonstrate empirically the limitations of word embeddings, and the opportunities the multilingual pre-trained language model (PLM) offers especially for languages unseen during pre-training and low-resource scenarios. We further study how to adapt and specialize multilingual PLMs to unseen African languages using a small amount of monolingual texts. To address the under-representation of the African languages in NLP research, we developed large scale human-annotated labelled datasets for 21 African languages in two impactful NLP tasks: named entity recognition and machine translation.

Notably, most interpretability papers implement these maps as linear functions, motivated by the linear representation hypothesis: the idea that features are encoded linearly in a model's representations. However, this linearity constraint is not required by the definition of causal abstraction. In this work, we critically examine the concept of causal abstraction by considering arbitrarily powerful alignment maps. In particular, we prove that under reasonable assumptions, any neural network can be mapped to any algorithm, rendering this unrestricted notion of causal abstraction trivial and uninformative. We complement these theoretical findings with empirical evidence, demonstrating that it is possible to perfectly map models to algorithms even when these models are incapable of solving the actual task; e.g., on an experiment using randomly initialised language models, our alignment maps reach 100% interchange-intervention accuracy on the indirect object identification task. This raises the non-linear representation dilemma: if we lift the linearity constraint imposed to alignment maps in causal abstraction analyses, we are left with no principled way to balance the inherent trade-off between these maps' complexity and accuracy. Together, these results suggest an answer to our title's question: causal abstraction is not enough for mechanistic interpretability, as it becomes vacuous without assumptions about how models encode information. Studying the connection between this information-encoding assumption and causal abstraction should lead to exciting future work.","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08802v1","source":"ArXiv Domain","timestamp":"2025-07-11T17:59:55.000Z","metadata":{"arxivId":"2507.08802v1","authors":"Denis Sutter, Julian Minder, Thomas Hofmann, Tiago Pimentel","categories":"cs.LG","published":"2025-07-11T17:59:55Z","pdfUrl":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.08802v1.pdf","abstractUrl":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08802v1","rank":2,"domain":"AI"}},{"id":"arxiv-2507.08801v1-1752501534979","title":"Lumos-1: On Autoregressive Video Generation from a Unified Model Perspective","description":"Autoregressive large language models (LLMs) have unified a vast range of language tasks, inspiring preliminary efforts in autoregressive video generation.

In this paper, we introduce Lumos-1, an autoregressive video generator that retains the LLM architecture with minimal architectural modifications. To inject spatiotemporal correlations in LLMs, we identify the efficacy of incorporating 3D RoPE and diagnose its imbalanced frequency spectrum ranges. Therefore, we propose MM-RoPE, a RoPE scheme that preserves the original textual RoPE while providing comprehensive frequency spectra and scaled 3D positions for modeling multimodal spatiotemporal data. Moreover, Lumos-1 resorts to a token dependency strategy that obeys intra-frame bidirectionality and inter-frame temporal causality. Based on this dependency strategy, we identify the issue of frame-wise loss imbalance caused by spatial information redundancy and solve it by proposing Autoregressive Discrete Diffusion Forcing (AR-DF). AR-DF introduces temporal tube masking during training with a compatible inference-time masking policy to avoid quality degradation. By using memory-efficient training techniques, we pre-train Lumos-1 on only 48 GPUs, achieving performance comparable to EMU3 on GenEval, COSMOS-Video2World on VBench-I2V, and OpenSoraPlan on VBench-T2V.

To validate its effectiveness, we apply cache steering to induce chain-of-thought reasoning in small language models. Our approach leverages GPT-4o-generated reasoning traces to construct steering vectors that shift model behavior toward more explicit, multi-step reasoning without fine-tuning or prompt modifications. Experimental evaluations on diverse reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that cache steering improves both the qualitative structure of model reasoning and quantitative task performance. Compared to prior activation steering techniques that require continuous interventions, our one-shot cache steering offers substantial advantages in terms of hyperparameter stability, inference-time efficiency, and ease of integration, making it a more robust and practical solution for controlled generation.","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08799v1","source":"ArXiv Domain","timestamp":"2025-07-11T17:59:36.000Z","metadata":{"arxivId":"2507.08799v1","authors":"Max Belitsky, Dawid J.

This is a tricky question to answer in general, as any function matching the outputs on those examples can in principle be a correct extrapolant. We argue that a \"good\" extrapolant should follow certain kinds of rules, and here we study a particularly appealing criterion for rule-following in list functions: that the function should behave predictably even when certain elements are removed. In functional programming, a standard way to express such removal operations is by using a filter function. Accordingly, our paper introduces a new semantic class of functions -- the filter equivariant functions. We show that this class contains interesting examples, prove some basic theorems about it, and relate it to the well-known class of map equivariant functions. We also present a geometric account of filter equivariants, showing how they correspond naturally to certain simplicial structures. Our highlight result is the amalgamation algorithm, which constructs any filter-equivariant function's output by first studying how it behaves on sublists of the input, in a way that extrapolates perfectly.","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08796v1","source":"ArXiv Domain","timestamp":"2025-07-11T17:57:16.000Z","metadata":{"arxivId":"2507.08796v1","authors":"Owen Lewis, Neil Ghani, Andrew Dudzik, Christos Perivolaropoulos, Razvan Pascanu, Petar Veličković","categories":"cs.PL, cs.LG","published":"2025-07-11T17:57:16Z","pdfUrl":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.08796v1.pdf","abstractUrl":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08796v1","rank":6,"domain":"AI"}},{"id":"arxiv-2507.08794v1-1752501534979","title":"One Token to Fool LLM-as-a-Judge","description":"Generative reward models (also known as LLMs-as-judges), which use large language models (LLMs) to evaluate answer quality, are increasingly adopted in reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR). They are often preferred over rigid rule-based metrics, especially for complex reasoning tasks involving free-form outputs. In this paradigm, an LLM is typically prompted to compare a candidate answer against a ground-truth reference and assign a binary reward indicating correctness. Despite the seeming simplicity of this comparison task, we find that generative reward models exhibit surprising vulnerabilities to superficial manipulations: non-word symbols (e.g., \":\" or \".\") or reasoning openers like \"Thought process:\" and \"Let's solve this problem step by step.\" can often lead to false positive rewards. We demonstrate that this weakness is widespread across LLMs, datasets, and prompt formats, posing a serious threat for core algorithmic paradigms that rely on generative reward models, such as rejection sampling, preference optimization, and RLVR. To mitigate this issue, we introduce a simple yet effective data augmentation strategy and train a new generative reward model with substantially improved robustness. Our findings highlight the urgent need for more reliable LLM-based evaluation methods.

In general, risk-aversion leads to conservative exploration of the environment which typically results in converging to sub-optimal policies that fail to adequately maximise reward or, in some cases, fail to achieve the goal. In this paper, we propose an exploration-based approach for RaCRL called Optimistic Risk-averse Actor Critic (ORAC), which constructs an exploratory policy by maximising a local upper confidence bound of the state-action reward value function whilst minimising a local lower confidence bound of the risk-averse state-action cost value function. Specifically, at each step, the weighting assigned to the cost value is increased or decreased if it exceeds or falls below the safety constraint value. This way the policy is encouraged to explore uncertain regions of the environment to discover high reward states whilst still satisfying the safety constraints. Our experimental results demonstrate that the ORAC approach prevents convergence to sub-optimal policies and improves significantly the reward-cost trade-off in various continuous control tasks such as Safety-Gymnasium and a complex building energy management environment CityLearn.","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08793v1","source":"ArXiv Domain","timestamp":"2025-07-11T17:54:54.000Z","metadata":{"arxivId":"2507.08793v1","authors":"James McCarthy, Radu Marinescu, Elizabeth Daly, Ivana Dusparic","categories":"cs.LG, cs.AI","published":"2025-07-11T17:54:54Z","pdfUrl":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.08793v1.pdf","abstractUrl":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08793v1","rank":8,"domain":"AI"}},{"id":"arxiv-2506.19703v2-1752501534979","title":"Learning-aided Bigraph Matching Approach to Multi-Crew Restoration of Damaged Power Networks Coupled with Road Transportation Networks","description":"The resilience of critical infrastructure networks (CINs) after disruptions, such as those caused by natural hazards, depends on both the speed of restoration and the extent to which operational functionality can be regained. Allocating resources for restoration is a combinatorial optimal planning problem that involves determining which crews will repair specific network nodes and in what order. This paper presents a novel graph-based formulation that merges two interconnected graphs, representing crew and transportation nodes and power grid nodes, into a single heterogeneous graph. To enable efficient planning, graph reinforcement learning (GRL) is integrated with bigraph matching. GRL is utilized to design the incentive function for assigning crews to repair tasks based on the graph-abstracted state of the environment, ensuring generalization across damage scenarios. Two learning techniques are employed: a graph neural network trained using Proximal Policy Optimization and another trained via Neuroevolution. The learned incentive functions inform a bipartite graph that links crews to repair tasks, enabling weighted maximum matching for crew-to-task allocations. An efficient simulation environment that pre-computes optimal node-to-node path plans is used to train the proposed restoration planning methods. An IEEE 8500-bus power distribution test network coupled with a 21 square km transportation network is used as the case study, with scenarios varying in terms of numbers of damaged nodes, depots, and crews. Results demonstrate the approach's generalizability and scalability across scenarios, with learned policies providing 3-fold better performance than random policies, while also outperforming optimization-based solutions in both computation time (by several orders of magnitude) and power restored.","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19703v2","source":"ArXiv Domain","timestamp":"2025-06-24T15:12:45.000Z","metadata":{"arxivId":"2506.19703v2","authors":"Nathan Maurer, Harshal Kaushik, Roshni Anna Jacob, Jie Zhang, Souma Chowdhury","categories":"cs.LG","published":"2025-06-24T15:12:45Z","pdfUrl":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.19703v2.pdf","abstractUrl":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19703v2","rank":9,"domain":"AI"}},{"id":"arxiv-2506.18247v2-1752501534979","title":"Exploring Efficient Quantification of Modeling Uncertainties with Differentiable Physics-Informed Machine Learning Architectures","description":"Quantifying and propagating modeling uncertainties is crucial for reliability analysis, robust optimization, and other model-based algorithmic processes in engineering design and control. Now, physics-informed machine learning (PIML) methods have emerged in recent years as a new alternative to traditional computational modeling and surrogate modeling methods, offering a balance between computing efficiency, modeling accuracy, and interpretability. However, their ability to predict and propagate modeling uncertainties remains mostly unexplored. In this paper, a promising class of auto-differentiable hybrid PIML architectures that combine partial physics and neural networks or ANNs (for input transformation or adaptive parameter estimation) is integrated with Bayesian Neural networks (replacing the ANNs); this is done with the goal to explore whether BNNs can successfully provision uncertainty propagation capabilities in the PIML architectures as well, further supported by the auto-differentiability of these architectures. A two-stage training process is used to alleviate the challenges traditionally encountered in training probabilistic ML models. The resulting BNN-integrated PIML architecture is evaluated on an analytical benchmark problem and flight experiments data for a fixed-wing RC aircraft, with prediction performance observed to be slightly worse or at par with purely data-driven ML and original PIML models. Moreover, Monte Carlo sampling of probabilistic BNN weights was found to be most effective in propagating uncertainty in the BNN-integrated PIML architectures.","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18247v2","source":"ArXiv Domain","timestamp":"2025-06-23T02:32:20.000Z","metadata":{"arxivId":"2506.18247v2","authors":"Manaswin Oddiraju, Bharath Varma Penumatsa, Divyang Amin, Michael Piedmonte, Souma Chowdhury","categories":"cs.LG","published":"2025-06-23T02:32:20Z","pdfUrl":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.18247v2.pdf","abstractUrl":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18247v2","rank":10,"domain":"AI"}}]}
